## Introduction
![landing_page](/documentation/images/landing_page.png)
*The Landing Page gives adequent explanation to my purpose of building this web app*

This website was created for only one purpose - to introduce tourists who are visiting Singapore hidden local restaurants/dessert/hawker stalls that Singaporeans often visit, but not really known by tourists.

I consider myself a foodie, and whenever I am travelling to a new country, I value experiencing local dishes and places that are frequently visited by the local people. I believe such experience is valuable and gives me new inspiration that I could not think of at my home country.

To travellers who are like me out there around the globe, I would like to present my findings of food lists of Singapore, not just in a format of google map bookmarks, but in a rather more interesting way of presentation; using 3D map representations

## 0. NextJS App with Three.js
This web app also serves purpose for me to brush my frontend development skills, in addition to introducing local food places of Singapore by allowing users to interact in the virtual 3D map of Singapore to explore new hidden gems and locations for food.

It was an opportunity for me to pick up new tech stacks such as three.js + DREI components,
as well as to apply the best frontend development practices that I learned while prepraing for my job search. More detailed research and analysis is written below.

## 1. Tech Stacks Implemented
* [NextJS]() + [React19]() + Typescript
* [React Three DREI + Fiber]() + [three.js]() for 3D Canvas Rendering
* [zustand]() for State Management
* [TailwindCSS]() for CSS tools + [clsx]()
* [flag-icons]() for Locale Flags
* [Material UI Icons]() for Google Icons
* [next-intl](https://next-intl.dev/) used for i18n implementation
